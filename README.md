# Angular Resizable

Fork of an original work Angular Resizable: [https://codepen.io/Reklino/pen/raRaXq](https://codepen.io/Reklino/pen/raRaXq).

A lightweight directive for creating resizable containers. The idea behind it was to completely separate the 'layout logic' from the 'resize logic'. Every other directive/plugin I came across tied these together. I wanted to make the CSS do the hard work. This demo uses flex-box for layout.
